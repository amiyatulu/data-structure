To calculate the mean of a set of values in Rust using the `statrs` crate, follow these steps:

1. First, add the `statrs` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
statrs = "0.15"
```

2. Create a Rust program to calculate the mean:

```rust
use statrs::statistics::Statistics;

fn main() {
    // Define a vector of values
    let values = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0];

    // Calculate the mean using the mean() method from the Statistics trait
    let mean = values.mean();

    // Print the mean
    println!("The mean is: {}", mean);
}
```

In this example:

1. The `statrs::statistics::Statistics` trait is imported.
2. A vector of values is defined.
3. The `mean()` method from the `Statistics` trait is used to calculate the mean of the values.
4. The mean is printed to the console.

Run this program using `cargo run`, and it will output the mean of the values.
