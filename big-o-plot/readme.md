Sure! Let's break down this piece of code step by step:

```rust
chart
    .draw_series(LineSeries::new(
        (1..=1000).map(|n| (n as f64, (n as f64).ln())),
        &RED,
    ))?
    .label("log(n)")
    .legend(|(x, y)| PathElement::new([(x, y), (x + 20, y)], &RED));
```

### Explanation:

1. **chart.draw_series**:
   - This method is used to draw a series of data points on the chart. In this case, it is drawing a line series.

2. **LineSeries::new**:
   - `LineSeries` is a struct provided by the `plotters` crate to represent a series of data points connected by lines.
   - `LineSeries::new` takes two arguments:
     1. An iterator that produces the data points.
     2. A reference to a color.

3. **(1..=1000).map(|n| (n as f64, (n as f64).ln()))**:
   - This is the iterator that produces the data points.
   - `(1..=1000)` creates a range from 1 to 1000.
   - `.map(|n| (n as f64, (n as f64).ln()))` transforms each integer `n` in the range into a tuple `(n as f64, (n as f64).ln())`.
     - `n as f64` converts the integer `n` to a floating-point number.
     - `(n as f64).ln()` computes the natural logarithm of `n`.
   - Thus, the iterator produces tuples of the form `(n, log(n))` where `n` ranges from 1 to 1000.

4. **&RED**:
   - This specifies the color of the line series. In this case, the line will be red.

5. **?**:
   - This is the error propagation operator in Rust. It ensures that if there is an error in drawing the series, the error is returned from the function immediately.

6. **.label("log(n)")**:
   - This sets the label for the series. The label "log(n)" will be used in the chart's legend.

7. **.legend(|(x, y)| PathElement::new([(x, y), (x + 20, y)], &RED))**:
   - This customizes the appearance of the legend for this series.
   - `legend` takes a closure that describes how to draw the legend item.
   - `|(x, y)| PathElement::new([(x, y), (x + 20, y)], &RED)` is the closure.
     - It takes coordinates `(x, y)` where the legend item should be drawn.
     - `PathElement::new([(x, y), (x + 20, y)], &RED)` creates a path element (a small line segment) from `(x, y)` to `(x + 20, y)` in red color. This line segment will be shown in the legend next to the label "log(n)".

### Summary:
This piece of code draws a red line on the chart representing the function `log(n)` for values of `n` from 1 to 1000. It also adds a corresponding entry in the chart's legend labeled "log(n)" with a red line segment.
