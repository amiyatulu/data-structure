# Big O constant factors

Sure! Let's illustrate the concept of how \( O(5n) \) simplifies to \( O(n) \) using a simple example.

### Explanation

In Big-O notation, we describe the complexity of an algorithm in terms of the input size \( n \). When we say \( O(5n) \), it means the algorithm takes time proportional to \( 5n \). However, Big-O notation focuses on the growth rate and ignores constant factors because they become insignificant as \( n \) approaches infinity. Thus, \( O(5n) \) is simplified to \( O(n) \).

### Example

Imagine we have two different algorithms that process a list of \( n \) elements:

1. **Algorithm A** takes 5 steps for each element.
2. **Algorithm B** takes 1 step for each element.

Even though Algorithm A takes more steps per element, both algorithms have linear complexity because the time it takes grows directly with the number of elements \( n \).

#### Pseudocode Example

Here’s a pseudocode example for both algorithms:

**Algorithm A (5 steps per element):**
```plaintext
for each element in list:
    step 1
    step 2
    step 3
    step 4
    step 5
```
This algorithm performs \( 5n \) operations, so its time complexity is \( O(5n) \).

**Algorithm B (1 step per element):**
```plaintext
for each element in list:
    step 1
```
This algorithm performs \( n \) operations, so its time complexity is \( O(n) \).

### Visualization

To help visualize this, let's plot the number of operations for different input sizes \( n \) for both algorithms.

1. **X-axis (horizontal):** Number of elements \( n \).
2. **Y-axis (vertical):** Number of operations.

We'll plot two lines:
- One for Algorithm A (5 operations per element).
- One for Algorithm B (1 operation per element).

Let's create the plot!

### Rust Plotter Code Example

Here’s the code to generate the plot using the `plotters` crate:

```rust
use plotters::prelude::*;
use std::error::Error;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // Create a drawing area for the plot
    let root = BitMapBackend::new("complexity_plot.png", (800, 600)).into_drawing_area();
    root.fill(&WHITE)?;

    // Define the chart
    let mut chart = ChartBuilder::on(&root)
        .caption("Algorithm Complexity: O(5n) vs O(n)", ("sans-serif", 50))
        .margin(10)
        .x_label_area_size(30)
        .y_label_area_size(30)
        .build_cartesian_2d(0..30, 0..150)?;

    chart.configure_mesh().draw()?;

    // Algorithm A data (5 operations per element)
    let algorithm_a_data: Vec<(i32, i32)> = (0..=30).map(|n| (n, 5 * n)).collect();
    chart.draw_series(LineSeries::new(
        algorithm_a_data,
        &BLUE,
    ))?.label("Algorithm A (O(5n))").legend(|(x, y)| PathElement::new(vec![(x, y), (x + 20, y)], &BLUE));

    // Algorithm B data (1 operation per element)
    let algorithm_b_data: Vec<(i32, i32)> = (0..=30).map(|n| (n, n)).collect();
    chart.draw_series(LineSeries::new(
        algorithm_b_data,
        &RED,
    ))?.label("Algorithm B (O(n))").legend(|(x, y)| PathElement::new(vec![(x, y), (x + 20, y)], &RED));

    // Configure the legend
    chart.configure_series_labels().background_style(&WHITE.mix(0.8)).border_style(&BLACK).draw()?;

    // Save the drawing
    root.present()?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Running the Code

1. Create a new Rust project if you don't already have one:
   ```sh
   cargo new plot_example
   cd plot_example
   ```

2. Add the `plotters` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   plotters = "0.3"
   ```

3. Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the provided Rust code.

4. Run the project:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

This will generate a file named `complexity_plot.png` in your project directory, which will contain the plot.

### Conclusion

In the plot, you'll see that while the blue line (Algorithm A) is steeper than the red line (Algorithm B), both lines grow linearly. The constant factor (5) in \( O(5n) \) doesn't change the fact that both algorithms have linear complexity \( O(n) \). As \( n \) gets very large, the difference between \( 5n \) and \( n \) becomes less significant in terms of growth rate, demonstrating why constant factors are disregarded in Big-O notation.
